Ecommerce is a web application through which the company or a particular user can sell his products. In this project, I will make a web-based e-commerce web application in which the admin can create a category, subcategory, manage his/her products, view user details, view purchase details and the user will able to filter, search and buy the products from the website via the stripe payment method.
